  // === BagsWorld Features Guide ===
  "BagsWorld has interactive commands that users can trigger through chat. Try 'make it rain' to shower coins, 'party time' for fireworks, 'call the butterfly' to summon butterflies, or 'scare the cat' for chaos.",
  "Buildings in BagsWorld can be clicked to view detailed token information including market cap, 24-hour volume, fee earnings, building health percentage, and current level (1-5).",
  "Characters in BagsWorld can be clicked to start AI-powered conversations. Each of the 17 characters has a unique personality, domain expertise, and communication style powered by ElizaOS.",
  "The world health indicator in the top-left corner shows the overall ecosystem health as a percentage. This number drives the weather system and reflects real-time Bags.fm trading activity.",

  // === Animal Interactions ===
  "BagsWorld has interactive animals including a dog that can be petted, a cat that roams BagsCity, butterflies that appear during sunny weather, birds that fly overhead, and squirrels in the Park zone.",
  "The butterflies in BagsWorld are said to only appear when Bags Bot is in a good mood. In reality, they spawn more frequently during high world health (sunny weather) conditions.",
  "The dog and cat in BagsWorld have been observed getting along during bull markets. When both are visible and peaceful, old-timers consider it a historically bullish signal for the ecosystem.",
  "Squirrels in the Park zone sometimes behave erratically before major market moves. This is a fun community observation, not actual predictive analytics, but it adds to BagsWorld's charm.",

  // === World Events ===
  "Weather transitions in BagsWorld are not instant. The sky gradually shifts between states, and observant users can spot the transition happening before the weather indicator updates.",
  "When a new token is launched on Bags.fm, a building spawn animation plays in the appropriate zone. The building starts small and grows to its initial level over a few seconds.",
  "Building level-up events trigger a visual celebration when a token's market cap crosses a threshold. The building transforms with new architectural details reflecting its higher level.",
  "Night mode activates based on EST timezone and adds stars to the sky, changes the lighting palette to darker tones, and enables neon glow effects on BagsCity buildings.",

  // === User Onboarding ===
  "New users should start by exploring the Park zone and clicking on characters. Each character provides a different perspective on BagsWorld: Ash explains basics, Finn hypes the platform, Toly covers Solana tech.",
  "The zone navigation system lets users move between all 7 zones. Each zone has a distinct visual theme, resident characters, and unique buildings. Exploring all zones gives the fullest picture of BagsWorld.",
  "Users do not need a wallet to explore BagsWorld. Anyone can view buildings, talk to characters, and observe the world. Wallet connection is only needed for token-gated features like the Casino and Oracle.",
  "For users who want to launch tokens, Professor Oak in Founder's Corner provides step-by-step guidance. The AI-powered wizard can generate names, logos, and banners before walking creators through the launch process.",

  // === Easter Eggs ===
  "Saying 'gm' to Bags Bot triggers a warm greeting with a world health update. The response changes based on current weather conditions, making each morning interaction unique.",
  "World health hitting exactly 69% or 42.0% triggers special reaction messages from Bags Bot, referencing the crypto community's love of meme numbers.",
  "When world health reaches 100%, a rare event triggers across all zones with special visual effects. This is an extremely rare occurrence that requires massive ecosystem-wide trading activity.",
  "Clicking rapidly on buildings in sequence can trigger a combo counter easter egg. The exact sequence required changes periodically, keeping dedicated explorers searching.",

  // === Platform Knowledge ===
  "Bags Bot knows every feature of BagsWorld and can explain any mechanic in crypto-native language. When in doubt, ask Bags Bot. If it cannot help directly, it will point to the right character who can.",
  "The Trading Terminal in BagsCity displays real-time market data, charts, and token analytics. It pulls data from DexScreener and the Bags.fm API to give users comprehensive market views.",
  "The Casino in BagsCity requires 1 million $BagsWorld tokens and offers community-funded prizes from Ghost's 5% revenue contribution. The Oracle Tower at 2 million tokens offers prediction markets.",
