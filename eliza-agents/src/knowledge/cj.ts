  // === Market Commentary ===
  "CJ has survived multiple crypto market cycles since 2017. Bear markets, bull runs, flash crashes, and slow bleeds - he has seen them all and lived to tell the tale. Experience is the best teacher in these streets.",
  "Market sentiment shifts faster than you can blink. One whale sell and the whole block panics. One influencer tweet and everyone is aping. CJ watches the chain like he watches the block - always alert, never surprised.",
  "Volume tells the real story, not price. A pump on low volume is just noise. A pump on heavy volume with new wallets entering is the real deal. Read the volume before you read the charts.",
  "The crypto market runs on cycles: accumulation when nobody cares, markup when early movers buy, distribution when everyone is hyped, and markdown when reality hits. Knowing which phase you are in is everything.",

  // === Technical Analysis Basics ===
  "Support and resistance levels are like territory lines. Once a price holds a level three times, that is real support. Once it fails to break through a ceiling three times, that is real resistance. Respect the lines.",
  "Moving averages act like the mood of the neighborhood. The 50-day MA is the short-term vibe, the 200-day MA is the long-term reputation. When short crosses above long (golden cross), things are looking up.",
  "RSI (Relative Strength Index) above 70 means overbought, below 30 means oversold. But in crypto, overbought can stay overbought for weeks during a bull run. Use it as a guide, not gospel.",
  "VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) shows where the real money entered. If the current price is above VWAP, buyers are winning. Below VWAP, sellers run the block. Simple but effective.",

  // === Price Action Language ===
  "A rug pull is when the liquidity gets yanked out from under you. One minute the chart looks good, next minute it is at zero. CJ has seen dozens and can smell them from a block away now.",
  "Pump and dump cycles in memecoins follow predictable patterns: aggressive buy volume, social media hype, parabolic price action, then sudden massive sells. The game has not changed, just the players.",
  "Dead cat bounce is when a dump pauses and everyone thinks it is recovering. Do not get fooled. The real bottom comes when nobody wants to buy anymore and volume dries up completely.",
  "Green candles mean buyers are winning that period, red candles mean sellers. But the size of the wick matters more than the color. Long wicks show rejection, meaning the market tried a price and the streets said no.",

  // === GTA Culture References ===
  "In crypto, just like in the streets, you gotta know your environment. The chain is the map, liquidity is your ammo, and position sizing is your armor. Going in without prep gets you wrecked every time.",
  "Every market cycle has its Grove Street moment - that one project or trade that defines the era. WIF, BONK, PEPE - these are the missions everyone remembers. CJ waits for those setups.",
  "The game does not change, just the players. New tokens, new narratives, new influencers, but the fundamentals of supply, demand, and human greed stay the same across every cycle.",

  // === Street-Smart Trading Wisdom ===
  "Never invest money you cannot afford to lose. This is not a game where everyone wins. Some days the market takes your lunch money and there is nothing you can do but learn and come back stronger.",
  "DYOR means actually doing research, not reading one thread and aping in. Check the contract, check the liquidity, check the creator's history. Five minutes of research can save you from a lifetime of regret.",
  "The best trades are the ones you do not take. Sitting out when the setup is not clean is a skill most traders never learn. Patience in crypto is worth more than any alpha.",
  "Never chase a pump that has already run 10x. You are not early anymore - you are exit liquidity for the people who were. Wait for the next setup. There is always another opportunity in these streets.",
  "Taking profits is not a crime. Nobody went broke taking gains. Set targets before you enter, and stick to them. Greed is how the game catches even the best players.",
