  // === Fee Claiming Mechanics ===
  "On Bags.fm, creators earn 1% of all trading volume on their token forever. This is enforced at the protocol level through audited smart contracts. No one can change or revoke this royalty after launch.",
  "Creators claim accumulated fees at bags.fm/claim by connecting their wallet and signing a transaction. Fees accumulate in real-time from every trade, and there is no expiration on unclaimed fees.",
  "Fee sharing is configured at launch by assigning percentages to Twitter, GitHub, or Kick usernames. Each recipient must link their wallet at bags.fm/settings before they can claim their share.",
  "The fee share split distributes the 1% trading royalty among up to 3 creators. Percentages must total exactly 100%. Once set at launch, fee shares are immutable and cannot be changed.",

  // === Creator Success Strategies ===
  "The most successful Bags.fm creators share three traits: they build genuine communities around their tokens, they create content consistently, and they claim fees regularly to reinvest in their projects.",
  "Token naming matters enormously for success. The best-performing tokens have memorable 3-8 character tickers, tell a clear story in their description, and have eye-catching logos that stand out in feeds.",
  "Community building is the single biggest driver of sustained volume. Creators who engage daily with their token holders, share updates, and celebrate milestones together consistently outperform those who launch and disappear.",
  "The first 24 hours after launch are critical. Successful creators prepare a marketing thread, coordinate with their community for initial buys, and maintain active engagement in their token's discussion channels.",

  // === Marketing Playbooks ===
  "The shill thread formula that converts: hook with a bold claim, explain the token's unique angle in 2-3 tweets, show social proof (community size, early volume), and end with a clear call-to-action linking to bags.fm.",
  "Timing social media posts for maximum impact follows CT (Crypto Twitter) patterns: US morning (8-10am EST) for American audiences, EU morning (8-10am CET) for European audiences, and Asia evening (7-9pm JST) for Asian audiences.",
  "Referral programs are the most capital-efficient growth lever. Each new holder who becomes an evangelist can bring 5-10 more holders through word of mouth, creating a compounding flywheel effect.",
  "The best marketing budget is zero at the start. Build organic traction first to prove product-market fit, then amplify what is already working. Paid promotion on tokens without organic community interest wastes money.",

  // === Launch Optimization ===
  "The optimal initial buy at launch should balance showing creator commitment without creating an oversized position that might concern potential buyers. Most successful launches start with modest creator buys.",
  "Token descriptions should be concise (under 280 characters), clearly communicate the token's purpose or meme, and include relevant keywords that help with discoverability in search and feeds.",
  "DexScreener Enhanced listing costs $299 and requires a 512x512px square logo, 1500x500px banner, and linked socials. The increased visibility makes this investment worthwhile for tokens with active communities.",

  // === Volume Analysis ===
  "Daily trading volume is the primary driver of creator earnings. A token with $100K daily volume generates $1,000 in daily fees, which at 1% split among creators can produce meaningful passive income.",
  "Volume patterns follow predictable cycles: spikes around launches and major news, steady state during normal activity, and dips during broad market downturns. Successful creators maintain engagement through all phases.",
  "The Bags.fm platform reached $1 billion in total volume within 30 days of launch, demonstrating the product-market fit of the perpetual royalty model for token creators.",

  // === Platform Vision ===
  "Bags.fm exists to flip the creator economy model. Instead of platforms taking all the revenue, creators earn a permanent share of every trade. This is not charity but a better-aligned incentive structure.",
  "The future of Bags.fm includes deeper integrations with social platforms, enabling creators from TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram to earn crypto royalties from their content without understanding blockchain.",
  "Memes are culture, and culture is the new currency. The most valuable tokens on Bags.fm are not just financial instruments but cultural artifacts that communities rally around and defend.",
