  // === Growth Hacking ===
  "Bags.fm grew from zero to 100K followers using zero paid advertising. The strategy was entirely organic: compelling product, community-generated content, and strategic KOL engagement.",
  "The referral program creates a compounding flywheel: each new user who becomes an evangelist brings 5-10 more users. The top referrers on Bags.fm have each driven over $200K in platform volume.",
  "Viral coefficient (K-factor) is the key metric. If every user brings more than one new user on average (K > 1), growth becomes exponential. Bags.fm's referral mechanics were designed to push K above 1.",
  "Product-led growth means the product itself drives acquisition. When Bags.fm users earn their first fees, they naturally share their success, creating authentic testimonials that outperform any paid campaign.",

  // === Marketing Strategy ===
  "The content-first approach: every feature launch, milestone, and community win gets turned into shareable content. The team's job is to make the community's successes visible and easy to share.",
  "Timing matters as much as content quality. CT (Crypto Twitter) engagement peaks at US morning (8-10am EST), EU afternoon (2-4pm CET), and Asia evening (8-10pm JST). Schedule posts to hit multiple audiences.",
  "Narrative marketing creates lasting impressions. Rather than listing features, tell stories: a creator who earned their first SOL in fees, a community that grew from 10 to 10K holders, a token that evolved from Level 1 to Level 5.",
  "The WIF hat moment taught a critical lesson: authentic cultural moments cannot be manufactured but can be amplified. When organic viral moments happen, the team's job is to fuel them, not control them.",

  // === Community Growth ===
  "Community building follows a power law: 1% of users create content, 9% engage with content, and 90% consume content. The strategy is to grow the 1% creator class because they drive everything else.",
  "Discord community health metrics: daily active users, message count, new member retention (7-day return rate), and support response time. A healthy community has consistent daily activity, not just spike-and-crash patterns.",
  "Ambassador programs convert enthusiastic users into force multipliers. Identify users who already help others, formalize their role, give them early access to news and features, and recognize their contributions publicly.",
  "Community events (AMAs, launch parties, trading competitions) create scheduled engagement peaks. Regular weekly events train the community to show up at predictable times, building habits around participation.",

  // === KOL Engagement ===
  "KOL (Key Opinion Leader) strategy is quality over quantity. One genuine advocate who uses the product daily is worth more than ten paid promoters who post once and move on.",
  "Authentic KOL relationships start with the product. Get the product in their hands, let them explore naturally, and facilitate (do not script) their content. Audiences detect paid shills instantly.",
  "Micro-KOLs (5K-50K followers) often deliver better ROI than mega-KOLs (500K+). Their audiences are more engaged, their recommendations carry more trust, and they are more willing to build long-term relationships.",

  // === Content Strategy ===
  "The content mix that works for crypto projects: 40% educational (how-tos, explainers), 30% social proof (user wins, milestones), 20% community (memes, conversations), 10% announcements (features, updates).",
  "Thread format consistently outperforms single tweets for engagement. The ideal structure: hook tweet (bold claim or question), 3-5 supporting points with visuals, and a summary tweet with clear CTA.",
  "User-generated content (UGC) is the most trusted and cost-effective content type. Create frameworks that make it easy for users to share: milestone templates, claim celebration templates, and launch announcement templates.",

  // === Social Media Optimization ===
  "The Twitter algorithm rewards replies and quote tweets more than likes. Design content that prompts conversation: ask questions, share hot takes, and create fill-in-the-blank style posts.",
  "Fake followers are an engagement death sentence. The algorithm detects accounts with high follower counts but low engagement and suppresses their content. Organic growth is slower but compounds sustainably.",
  "Cross-platform amplification: viral crypto content often starts on Twitter, moves to Discord for discussion, gets screenshotted for Reddit, and reaches mainstream through TikTok. Be present everywhere the conversation flows.",
