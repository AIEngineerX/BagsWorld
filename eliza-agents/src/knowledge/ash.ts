  // === Onboarding Basics ===
  "New users should think of BagsWorld like a Pokemon region to explore. Each zone has different features to discover, characters to talk to, and activities to try. Start in the Park zone to get oriented.",
  "Connecting a Solana wallet to BagsWorld is like choosing your first partner Pokemon. Phantom, Solflare, and Backpack are the most popular wallets. Once connected, users can interact with buildings, characters, and token gates.",
  "The first thing new users should do is explore the Park zone, talk to characters, and observe how buildings change with market activity. Understanding the world visually makes the on-chain mechanics click.",

  // === Pokemon Analogies for Crypto ===
  "Token market cap levels are like Pokemon evolution stages. A Level 1 building (under $100K) is like a Charmander, Level 3 ($500K-$2M) is a Charmeleon, and Level 5 ($10M+) is a fully evolved Charizard dominating the skyline.",
  "Fee claiming on Bags.fm is like collecting XP after every battle. The more trading volume your token generates, the more XP (fees) you earn. Let it accumulate too long and you are wasting potential evolution energy.",
  "World health works like the weather system in Pokemon games. Sunny days (80%+ health) mean the ecosystem is thriving with high trading activity. Storm weather (20-40%) means things are quiet, but every trainer knows storms pass.",
  "Token gates are like Gym Badges in BagsWorld. You need 1 million $BagsWorld tokens for the Casino (like the first badge) and 2 million for the Oracle Tower (like a higher-tier badge). Each gate unlocks new features.",
  "Building decay is like a Pokemon losing HP without potions. Buildings need sustained trading volume (the potion) to stay healthy. Without activity, they slowly weaken from Active to Warning to Critical to Dormant.",
  "Launching a token on Bags.fm through Professor Oak is like getting your starter Pokemon. It is the beginning of your journey, and how well you nurture your community determines how far it evolves.",

  // === Zone Guides ===
  "The Park is the starting zone, like Pallet Town. It is peaceful, green, and home to the PokeCenter building. New trainers (users) can meet Toly, Finn, Shaw, and Ghost here and learn the basics.",
  "BagsCity is the bustling urban zone, like Celadon City. It has the Casino (Game Corner equivalent), the Trading Terminal for market data, and the Oracle Tower for predictions. Neo and CJ patrol the neon streets.",
  "Ballers Valley is like the Elite Four headquarters, only accessible to top holders. The luxury mansions reflect the wealth of the biggest $BagsWorld token holders with increasingly elaborate pixel art.",
  "Founder's Corner is Professor Oak's lab where new creators learn to launch tokens. It is the educational hub of BagsWorld, equivalent to the Pokemon Lab where every trainer's journey begins.",
  "HQ is where the Bags.fm team works, like the Silph Co. building. Ramo, Sincara, Stuu, Sam, Alaa, Carlo, and BNN all operate from here, building and maintaining the platform infrastructure.",
  "Moltbook Beach is a tropical hangout zone for AI agents, like the Safari Zone for digital creatures. Agents post, interact, and socialize here with Openclaw lobsters wandering the beach.",
  "The MoltBook Arena is the Battle Stadium of BagsWorld where AI agents compete in real-time combat. Spectators watch from the crowd as agents clash using WebSocket-powered battle mechanics.",

  // === Feature Tutorials ===
  "To interact with a building in BagsWorld, click on it to see its token details: market cap, 24h volume, fee earnings, and health status. Each building tells the story of a real token on Bags.fm.",
  "Characters in BagsWorld can be clicked to start a conversation. Each character has a unique personality and area of expertise. Ask them questions about their domain and they will respond in character.",
  "The weather indicator in BagsWorld is not just cosmetic. It reflects the actual health of the Bags.fm ecosystem. Teach newcomers to read the weather as a quick health check of overall platform activity.",

  // === Beginner Education ===
  "DeFi can feel overwhelming, but BagsWorld makes it visual. Instead of reading charts, users watch buildings grow. Instead of tracking wallets, they see characters react. The game IS the dashboard.",
  "The most common beginner mistake is not claiming fees regularly. Like forgetting to heal Pokemon at the PokeCenter, unclaimed fees represent wasted potential that could be compounding or reinvested.",
