  // === Community Building ===
  "Carlo started as a Bags.fm community member and was hired because the community already treated him as staff. This origin story reflects the ideal path for ambassador recruitment: identify people who are already doing the work.",
  "The 'gm' chain in Discord is more than a greeting ritual. It creates daily touchpoints that train community members to check in, builds social bonds through consistency, and provides an organic activity metric.",
  "Community health is measured by depth of engagement, not just size. A 1,000-member Discord with 200 daily active users is healthier than a 10,000-member server with 50 daily actives. Quality over quantity.",
  "New member onboarding in the first 48 hours determines long-term retention. Users who interact with at least 3 community members and receive a helpful response in their first 2 days retain at 5x the rate of those who do not.",

  // === Ambassador Programs ===
  "The best ambassadors are identified, not recruited. Watch for community members who naturally answer questions, create content, welcome newcomers, and defend the project with facts during FUD. Those are your ambassadors.",
  "Ambassador tiers create progression: Community Helper (answers questions), Community Guide (creates content), Community Leader (organizes events), and Community Champion (strategic input and early access).",
  "Recognition matters more than rewards for genuine ambassadors. Public shoutouts, early access to features, direct team communication channels, and attribution for contributions drive long-term ambassador retention.",
  "Ambassador burnout is real and preventable. Rotate responsibilities, celebrate rest periods, share the load across multiple ambassadors, and check in on their wellbeing regularly. Sustainable contribution beats sprint-and-crash.",

  // === User Engagement ===
  "Engagement follows the 1-9-90 rule: 1% create content, 9% engage actively, 90% lurk. The strategy is to lower barriers at each level: make lurking valuable (information), engaging easy (reactions), and creating rewarding (recognition).",
  "Turning skeptics into believers requires patience and facts, not hype. When someone questions the project, respond with on-chain proof, specific numbers, and genuine enthusiasm. Authenticity converts better than marketing.",
  "Community calls and AMAs should feel like catching up with friends, not corporate presentations. Keep them informal, encourage questions, laugh at jokes, and make sure every attendee feels heard.",
  "User milestones deserve celebration: first fee claim, first successful launch, reaching a token gate threshold, or simply being active for 30 days. Public recognition creates positive reinforcement loops.",

  // === Feedback Loops ===
  "Community feedback is the fastest path to product-market fit. Users who report bugs and request features are the most invested users. Treat their input as gold, respond quickly, and close the loop when their feedback ships.",
  "Feature request prioritization uses a community signal approach: if 10+ unrelated users request the same feature independently, it moves to the top of the priority list. Organic demand is the best product signal.",
  "Negative feedback is more valuable than positive feedback. Users who complain are still invested enough to voice their concerns. Users who silently leave give you no signal at all. Seek out and address the complaints.",

  // === Events and Governance ===
  "Weekly community events create engagement rhythm: Monday AMAs, Wednesday workshops, Friday celebrations. Regular events train the community to show up consistently, building habits around participation.",
  "Community governance starts with small decisions: which feature to build next, which zone to design, which character to add. Giving the community ownership of decisions creates investment that money cannot buy.",
  "Event hosting tips: start on time, have a clear agenda but allow tangents, spotlight community achievements, preview upcoming features, and always end with a call to action that gives attendees something to do next.",
  "The best community events are the ones the community creates themselves. When members organize their own calls, competitions, or content challenges, the community has achieved self-sustaining momentum.",
