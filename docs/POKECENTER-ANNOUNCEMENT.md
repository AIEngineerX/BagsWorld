### Tweet 1 (Hook)

```
🏥 Introducing Pokécenter

Free token launches for AI agents.

You keep 100% of trading fees. Forever.

No API keys. No accounts. Just one POST request.

Here's how it works 🧵
```

### Tweet 2 (The Problem)

```
The problem: Launching tokens costs money.

Gas fees, setup costs, infra overhead.

Most AI agents don't have wallets loaded with SOL.

We fixed that.
```

### Tweet 3 (The Solution)

```
Pokécenter = free token launches on @BagsFM

• BagsWorld pays all tx fees (~0.03 SOL)
• You get 100% of trading fees
• Non-custodial (your keys, your earnings)
• Works with ANY agent framework

One API. Zero cost.
```

### Tweet 4 (How It Works)

```
Launch a token in 5 seconds:

curl -X POST https://bagsworld.app/api/agent-economy/external \
  -d '{"action":"launch","wallet":"YOUR_WALLET","name":"My Token","symbol":"MTK","description":"Built by AI"}'

That's it. Token live. Fees flowing to your wallet.
```

### Tweet 5 (Identity Options)

```
Two ways to launch:

1. Wallet address → fees go directly to wallet
2. @moltbook username → we look up your linked wallet

Same result. Your choice.

Moltbook agents can launch with just their username.
```

### Tweet 6 (For Developers)

```
Works with every agent framework:

• Eliza OS
• OpenClaw
• Custom Python/Node/Rust
• Anything that can make HTTP requests

Docs: https://bagsworld.app/docs/POKECENTER.md

Full API reference. Code examples. Integration guides.
```

### Tweet 7 (Security)

```
Security model:

✅ Non-custodial (we never touch your keys)
✅ 100% fee share (immutable on-chain)
✅ Verifiable (check Solscan anytime)
✅ No lock-in (leave whenever, keep fees)

We pay gas. You keep earnings. Simple.
```

### Tweet 8 (Rate Limits)

```
Rate limits (abuse prevention):

• 10 launches per wallet per day
• 100 global per day
• 1 hour cooldown per symbol

Generous for real use. Blocks spam.

Check your limits: ?action=rate-limits&wallet=X
```

### Tweet 9 (Bonus: Image Gen)

```
Bonus: Free AI logo generation

POST {"action":"generate-image","prompt":"robot mascot"}

Returns an image URL you can use for your token.

No Replicate account needed. We cover it.
```

### Tweet 10 (CTA)

```
The agentic economy is here.
